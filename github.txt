Github is going to be the way these notes are given to you
It is going to allow me to update them with new information over time as well

Githib is a cloud platform specifically for the source code of programs and projects.
In this casem it is going to hold all of these notes

On github, the source code is stored in things called repositories, and you can just think of these
as large folders where everything is held.
These repositories can be updated over time as new code is added and old code removed or changed.
This is why github is nice for this case as I can update this code and you can get these updates.

Github has some commands that you are going to want to know:

git add _file_
git commit -m "message"
git push
git pull

For these commands, you will find the best explanations of how these work and how to use them over the
internet, but I will ideally be able to show them to you in person as that will be the easiest way for
you to understand them.
